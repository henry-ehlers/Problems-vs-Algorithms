# Min and Max in an unsorted array

## Time Complexity
The best, worst, and average case scenario are all the same here, namely ***O(n)***. This is because the implementation here must traverse all *n* elements in the input list in order to find the maximum. The longer the list, the longer this implementation needs.

## Space Complexity
No additional information or function are added to the stack, so the space complexity is ***O(1)***.
